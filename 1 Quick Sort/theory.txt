Aim: To implement the quick sort sorting algorithm. 

Algorithm: Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.
Quicksort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the two resulting subarrays. This algorithm is quite efficient for large-sized data sets as its average and worst-case complexity are O(n2 ), respectively.
Step 1 − Choose the highest index value has pivot
Step 2 − Take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding pivot 
Step 3 − left points to the low index 
Step 4 − right points to the high 
Step 5 − while value at left is less than pivot move right 
Step 6 − while value at right is greater than pivot move left 
Step 7 − if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right 
Step 8 − if left ≥ right, the point where they met is new pivot
